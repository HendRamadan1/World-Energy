#TODO: see if we can make more plots (Hend)
#TODO: add 3 columns: at war and with_who, and continent (Hend)
the column names: at_war, with_who
at_war(0 or 1 column)
with_who(if at_war=1, then mention the countries that it is at war with, if there is more than 1 country, store the value inside it as a tuple)
Good luck!
